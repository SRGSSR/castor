Extend your iOS app to stream video and audio to any Google Castâ€“compatible receiver.

## Overview

The Castor framework provides a comprehensive set of tools to connect to a Google Cast receiver and control playback with ease:

- Discover available devices and transfer playback between senders and receivers using ``Cast``. Adding a modern device picker is as simple as including a ``CastButton`` in your app.
- Control playback on a connected receiver using a ``CastPlayer``. Load ``CastAsset``s based on entities, identifiers, or URLs. Dynamically add items to playlists, reorder them, or remove them as needed.
- Present a modern playback interface with ``CastPlayerView`` or design your own, either as a standalone experience or tightly integrated with your main player.
- Integrate compact controls using ``CastMiniPlayerView`` or create your own mini player.

The Castor framework integrates seamlessly with SwiftUI, leveraging its declarative and reactive design to accelerate iteration and refinement of your ideas.

> Tip: See the Google Cast SDK [official documentation](https://developers.google.com/cast) for best practices when adding Cast support to your app.
