Integrate Google Cast into an iOS application using the Castor SDK.

## Overview

To integrate Google Cast into an iOS application with ``Castor``, you must first configure your project. This includes obtaining the App ID for your receiver, adding the required network permissions in the _Info.plist_, and initializing the Cast context at launch.

## Configure the project

An App ID allows a Cast-enabled application to identify and communicate with an associated receiver, while network permissions ensure the app can discover and connect to compatible devices on the local network.

### Obtain an App ID

Each product should have its own dedicated receiver registered with a specific App ID in the [Google Cast Developer Console](https://developers.google.com/cast/codelabs/cast-receiver#3). Do not share the same App ID across products, as this can cause conflicts and degrade the user experience.  

During early development, you can use Googleâ€™s default receiver (App ID `CC1AD845`) to start building your sender while your dedicated receiver is in progress. Switch to your own receiver as soon as possible to ensure full functionality and a consistent experience.

### Configure the _Info.plist_ file

After obtaining your App ID, configure the _Info.plist_ file accordingly:

```xml
<key>NSBonjourServices</key>
<array>
  <string>_googlecast._tcp</string>
  <string>_<YOUR_APP_ID>._googlecast._tcp</string>
</array>

<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>${PRODUCT_NAME} uses the local network to discover Cast-enabled devices on your WiFi network.</string>
```

These entries are required for iOS to allow local network access and device discovery using _Bonjour_.

### Initialize the Google Cast SDK

Next, the Google Cast SDK must be initialized at application launch.

Here is an example of initialization in the `UIApplicationDelegate`. Two approaches are shown, using the default Cast receiver and a custom Cast receiver identifier.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
@TabNavigator {
    @Tab("Default Receiver") {
        Shows how to initialize the Google Cast SDK using the default Cast receiver.

        ```swift 
        import GoogleCast

        final class AppDelegate: NSObject, UIApplicationDelegate {
            func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
                let criteria = GCKDiscoveryCriteria(applicationID: kGCKDefaultMediaReceiverApplicationID)
                let options = GCKCastOptions(discoveryCriteria: criteria)
                GCKCastContext.setSharedInstanceWith(options)
                return true
            }
        }
        ```
    }

    @Tab("Custom Receiver") {
        Shows how to initialize the Google Cast SDK using a custom Cast receiver ID. Replace **`<YOUR_APP_ID>`** with the App ID of your own Cast receiver.

        ```swift
        import GoogleCast

        final class AppDelegate: NSObject, UIApplicationDelegate {
            func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
                let criteria = GCKDiscoveryCriteria(applicationID: "<YOUR_APP_ID>")
                let options = GCKCastOptions(discoveryCriteria: criteria)
                GCKCastContext.setSharedInstanceWith(options)
                return true
            }
        }
        ```
    }
}
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

## Lifecycle management

Once the project is properly configured and the Google Cast SDK is initialized, the next step is to integrate ``Castor`` itself. ``Castor`` provides a high-level abstraction around the `GoogleCast` SDK, centralizing the logic for discovery, connection, and session management through its core component: the ``Cast`` object.

### Initialization

The ``Cast`` object is the central entry point of the Castor library. It acts as an observable object that integrates directly with the Google Cast SDK and exposes a higher-level API.

A ``Cast`` instance is responsible for:

- Discovering and managing available devices on the local network  
- Starting and ending sessions with a selected device  
- Exposing the active session and its connection state  
- Controlling volume and mute state on the receiver  
- Handling media playback through the associated ``CastPlayer``  
- Notifying the application about lifecycle events via its delegate.

By storing the ``Cast`` instance at the top level of your application as a [`StateObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/stateobject), you ensure that session management and device discovery remain active throughout the app lifecycle. Injecting it into SwiftUI's environment using [`environmentObject(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/environmentobject(_:)) allows any child view to access it via [`@EnvironmentObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environmentobject).

```swift
import Castor
import SwiftUI

@main
struct MyApp: App {
    @StateObject private var cast = Cast()

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .environmentObject(cast)
        }
    }
}
```

### Establish a session

Once your ``Cast`` object is initialized and available in your SwiftUI views, you can start a ``Cast`` session in two main ways:

1. Using the ``CastButton``: This button automatically displays available devices and allows the user to initiate a session by selecting a device.
2. Manually listing devices: You can access the list of available devices via the ``Cast`` object and start a session programmatically using ``Cast/startSession(with:)``.

### Handle session events

Once the ``Cast`` object is instantiated and injected into the environment, your app needs a way to respond to session lifecycle events. ``Castor`` provides two protocols for this: ``CastDelegate`` and ``Castable``.

By using both protocols, you can clearly separate responsibilities:

- ``CastDelegate`` manages Cast session transitions at the app level, handling navigation, UI updates, and other global behaviors.
- ``Castable`` manages Cast session transitions at the view level, handling synchronization between a local player and a remote player.

#### Delegate

This protocol is designed for global session handling, often implemented by a top-level object like a router. Its ``CastDelegate/castEndSession(with:)`` method provides a ``CastResumeState`` when a session stops, so your app can decide how to handle playback resumption.

Attach a delegate to a ``Cast`` instance using the ``SwiftUICore/View/supportsCast(_:with:)`` modifier, typically at the root view of your application.

#### Castable

This protocol is designed for playback-related contexts, typically views or objects that manage media playback. It is commonly implemented by models underlying local player views, enabling playback to be transferred between sender and receiver:

- **Session start**: ``Castable/castStartSession()`` returns a ``CastResumeState`` that allows transfer of local playback to a Cast receiver, including synchronization of position, audio selection, and subtitle tracks.
- **Session end**: ``Castable/castEndSession(with:)`` receivers the ``CastResumeState`` to synchronize playback in the opposite direction, from the remote Cast session back to the local player.

To define a local playback context, apply the ``SwiftUICore/View/castable(_:with:)`` modifier to a player view hierarchy, passing the ``Castable`` object as a parameter.

> Important: ``CastResumeState`` is built from the queue items returned by the receiver in its media status information. For proper resumption with all items when ending a session, the receiver must return the complete list of items.
