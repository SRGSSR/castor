Integrate the Cast experience into your application.

## Overview

``Castor`` offers modern SwiftUI views that are simple to integrate. It also provides APIs that let you build fully customized player interfaces.

## Standard views

Castor includes several built-in views to cover common Cast use cases.

> Tip: By default, the provided views use the `.accentColor`. You can change this color using the `.foregroundStyle` modifier, but note that this will not affect the color within the child views or a ``SwiftUI/Slider`` color. To update the default `accentColor` in the view displayed by the ``CastButton``, use the `.tint` modifier.

### Cast button

``CastButton`` is a SwiftUI view that displays a receiver selection popover (or a modal sheet, depending on the available width) and automatically reflects the current connection state.

For example, you can add a Cast button to a toolbar as follows:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject private var cast: Cast

    var body: some View {
        Color.clear
            .toolbar {
                CastButton(cast: cast)
            }
    }
}
```

> Note: To create a custom Cast button, use ``CastIcon``, which automatically animates according to the current ``Cast/connectionState``. You can then present the list of available ``Cast/devices`` with a custom experience, such as your own device picker.

### Mini and expanded views

> Important: These views will not be displayed unless a connection to a receiver device has been established and a content is loaded.

@TabNavigator {
    @Tab("Mini Player") {
        ``CastMiniPlayerView`` displays a compact view of the current Cast playback. Add the mini player to the bottom of your interface as follows:

        ```swift
        struct ContentView: View {
            @EnvironmentObject private var cast: Cast

            var body: some View {
                Color.clear
                    .safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom) {
                        CastMiniPlayerView(cast: cast)
                    }
            }
        }
        ```
    }

    @Tab("Expanded Player") {
        ``CastPlayerView`` presents a full player interface with connection status, artwork, and playback controls. Display the expanded player when the mini player is tapped, as follows:

        ```swift
        struct ContentView: View {
            @EnvironmentObject private var cast: Cast
            @State private var isPresented = false

            var body: some View {
                Color.clear
                    .safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom) {
                        CastMiniPlayerView(cast: cast)
                            .onTapGesture { isPresented.toggle() }
                    }
                    .sheet(isPresented: $isPresented) {
                        CastPlayerView(cast: cast)
                    }
            }
        }
        ```
    }
}
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

## Custom views

If the provided views don't meet your needs, you can create your own custom views from scratch:  

- To implement a Cast device selection list, use ``Cast``. With it, you can list available devices and start or end a session.  
- Once a session is established, the ``Cast`` object exposes a ``Cast/player`` property that provides a ``CastPlayer`` instance. You can use this instance to manage the player state and the item list.

When building a user interface, you can also use ``CastIcon`` to display the Cast connection state, or ``CastProgressTracker`` to handle playback positionâ€”for example, in combination with ``SwiftUI/Slider``.  

## Google Cast SDK views

The Google Cast SDK provides default views for sender applications, such as the Cast button and mini or expanded player UIs. While these views are fully functional, their appearance is somewhat outdated and they can be difficult to customize. For more details, see the [Google Cast iOS Sender UI customization guide](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/ios_sender/customize_ui#style_hierarchy).  

> Tip: To use these views in SwiftUI, wrap them with `UIViewRepresentable` or `UIViewControllerRepresentable`.
