# Known issues

This document lists known issues affecting Castor:

- Entries with a feedback number (`FBxxxxxxxx`) have been reported to Apple and are pending resolution in future iOS updates.
- Issues with a numeric identifier have been filed on the [Google Cast issue tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues?q=componentid:190205%20status:open&s=modified_time:desc) and may be addressed in upcoming Google Cast SDK updates.

## Incorrect time ranges and progress reporting for HLS live DVR streams ([397112872](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/397112872))

HLS live DVR streams report incorrect time ranges, which in turn causes inaccurate progress reporting for these streams.

### Workaround

No workaround is available yet.

## Items not updated during scrolling ([415626993](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/415626993))

When calling `CastPlayerItem.fetch()` to lazily load metadata for items in a scrollable view, updates are not delivered until scrolling stops.

Additionally, scrolling for an extended period during metadata fetching may cause the cast session to be suspended.

### Workaround

No workaround is available yet.

## Metadata fetch limited to 20 visible items ([412384508](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/412384508))

The Google Cast SDK limits metadata requests to a maximum of 20 visible `CastPlayerItem`s at a time. In scenarios such as displaying a list with more than 20 visible items, some entries may be unable to fetch their associated metadata.

### Workaround

No workaround is available yet.

## Long playlists cannot be loaded

Google Cast imposes a 64 kB [limit](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/media/messages) on message payloads. This restriction can prevent very large playlists from loading. Because each playlist entry may contain varying amounts of metadata, itâ€™s difficult to define a precise maximum number of items that will fit within this limit.

### Workaround

Limit the number of items in a playlist, or load them in smaller batches.
